Hi üëã

I ‚ô•Ô∏è open source. The idea of an open source fascinated me, and I've been working on open source software since 2017.

I am actively contributing to the development and maintenance of [KaTeX](https://github.com/KaTeX/KaTeX), a JavaScript library for TeX math rendering on the web.

I also contribute to other projects, including [SymPy](https://github.com/sympy/sympy), [Yarn Berry](https://github.com/yarnpkg/berry), [webpack](https://github.com/webpack), [Renovate](https://github.com/renovatebot/renovate), and many others.

Furthermore, my research interest is security, and I've been finding and reporting numerous vulnerabilities on popular services to make the world more secure.

If you like my work, please consider supporting me on [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/ylemkimon) or [PayPal](https://paypal.me/ylemkimon) :)
